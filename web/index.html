<h1>Fix Patents</h1>
<p>There is a patent crisis in America. Every day, businesses are threatened  by patent trolls â€” companies that make nothing, instead exploiting quasi-legal monopolies to extort money from businesses by threatening costly litigation. Laws intended long ago to protect inventors have been perverted by predatory lawyers to leech on the real economy.
<h2>How did we get here?</h2>
<p>In 16xx King James I (of King James Bible fame) passed a law to abolish all Monopolies. 
However, due to a loophole, it established the ability to patent inventions.
